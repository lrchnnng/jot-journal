## Automated vs Manual Testing

Automated testing and manual testing, when used in combination, are able to achieve a greater level of testing coverage. Automated testing is good for repetitive and critical tasks, while manual testing is good for new or changing requirements and exploratory testing.

## Manual Testing

</div>

---

Manual testing allows the tester to explore the site and using experience and creativity to find any issues within the site. It also takes into account flexibility and context, manual testing paramaters can be changed quickly depending on the requirements. The tester can also take into account the prospective users and their knowledge of the system in order to execute tests that are relevant.

## Automated Testing

</div>

Automated tests are repeatable and reliable as there is limited risk for human error. It allows for testing on both a small and a large scale in a quick and efficient manner. Automated testing might be used to test the performance of a site in order to ensure that it can handle page loading.

| Page | Test Results | Lighthouse Suggested Improvements |
|:---:|---|---|
|Index - Test 1|![First test index](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-index-test1.png)|Edit and delete buttons have no discernable name, I have fixed this by adding aria labels to the buttons in order to assist screen readers|
|Index - Test 2|![Second test index](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-index-test2.png)|Future goals: Create a custom 'disabled button' class style with higher contrast for the disabled sort button. Enable text compression and defer all non-critical JS and styles in order to stop resources from blocking the render.|
|---|---|---|
|Register - Test 1|![First test register](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-register-test1.png)|Future goals: Reduce unused JavaScript from MaterializeCSS|

|---|---|---|
|Profile - Test 1|![First test profile](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-profile-test1.png)|Future goals: Defer all non-critical JS and styles in order to stop resources from blocking the render lowering the time it takes to load the page.|
|---|---|---|
|Create Entry - Test 1|![First test create entry](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-create-test1.png)|Issues with contrast between background and foreground, I have changed the 'Choose Genre' dropdown font colour, and the font colour of the switch lever labels|
|Create Entry - Test 2|![Second test create entry](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-create-test2.png)|Future goals: Reduce unused JavaScript and reduce initial server response time to increase performance. I would also find a way to add a label to the dropdown genre menu to improve accessability score.|

|Edit Entry - Test 1|![First test edit entry](/static/images/testing-img/lighthouse-edit-test1.png)|Issues with contrast between button colour and font colour for the cancel button, I have fixed this by changing the font colour|

|Index|![WAVE index](/static/images/testing-img/wave-index.png)|Known error: Disabled sort button contrast is too low and I would address this on a later iteration|
|Register|![WAVE register](/static/images/testing-img/wave-register.png)|Missing h1 element: I used a h3 element instead of a h1 element to make styling easier|
|Log In|![WAVE Log In](/static/images/testing-img/wave-login.png)|Missing h1 element: I used a h3 element instead of a h1 element to make styling easier. WAVE is flagging the 'Register Here!' link as a redundant link as there is also a link in the nav bar on the same page.|

## JavaScript Testing <!-- omit in toc -->
[JSHint Testing](https://jshint.com/) - I ran the JS files through JSHint to make sure it was thoroughly tested, no issues were found.

## Python Testing
[Code Beautifier](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier#) - I ran my python code through this formatter to ensure that it met PEP8 guidlines.

## Known bugs and fixes 
- **Issue:** When connecting MongoDB I initially had issues with it not connecting a specific database.
  - **Solution:** Upon closer inspection, within my env.py file the pre-created Mongo URI link did not contain my specific database name. Once I had added this I was able to test the connection within the command line by adding and removing entries.
- **Issue:** When I had styled the dropdown genre selection to contain white text (in order to contrast with the darker background) I inadvertently targeted all dropdown components including the date picker within my 'Create Entry' and 'Edit Entry' forms. The date picker background was also white which caused the text to be unreadble to the user.
  - **Solution:** Using the 'Inspect' devtool within my browser I was able to directly target various elements of the date picker and change the background to match the rest of the application. I also utilised this when styling other aspects of the form (i.e the 'Would you recommend?' switch)
- **Issue:** My initial idea for the web application was to create a private journal. I spent a long time trying to find a way to only display the current session users entries to them on a private page that is only viewable when logged in.
  - **Solutions:** In the interests of time constraints and struggling to find answers to my issue I decided to change my idea and create a collaborative book review app that allows all users to edit and delete posts. 
- **Issue:** When a user added a new entry the entry would appear at the bottom as the entries as they were being displayed oldest first.
  - **Solutions:** Within my index function in app.py, I created a if/else statement and two variables (sort_option, sort_field) to create three buttons on the index page which allow the user to decide which order they would like to view the entries. I also used Jinja templating within the button class in order to add the 'disabled' class to the button so the user knows which sort option is in use and which are still available.
